''''Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b'''

#example 
a = 200
b = 300
if a == b:
    print("they are equal")
elif a > b: print("A is greater")
elif b > a: print("B is greater")

if a != b or a == b: print("alpha")
